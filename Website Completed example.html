The iPad came with apps capable of handling many of our routine tasks.These include a web browser, a mail client, a calendar, an alarm clock, a maps package, a notepad, a video conferencing app, and a contacts list. It also includes tablet-specific apps, such as a camera, a photo app, a video library, and an app for playing music.</p>

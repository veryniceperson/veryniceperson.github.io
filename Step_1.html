      <h1> Step 1: Writing the HTML code for your website </h1>

      <h2> In order to start creating your website you would need to learn how to code in HTML. In this step you
      will learn basic HTML, in order to write all of the content of your website.
        <br>
      <b>Let's get started!<b>
      </h2>

      <div class="HTMLcode_parts">
        <h3 style="margin-bottom:3%;"> Parts of HTML code </h3>
        <img src="https://github.com/veryniceperson/veryniceperson.github.io/blob/master/Images/HTML_Anatomy.png?raw=true" alt="Main parts of HTML code" width="40%" height="auto">
        <p> In the image to the right you would be able to see a diagram that represents
          the parts of a single element. The <b> element </b> is a part of code in HTML which
          consists of an HTML tag, the content inside and sometimes some styling.
          <br> </br>
          <b> HTML tag: </b>
          <br>
          The HTML tag contains the element name and helps classify a piece of content,
          because without the tag the browser wouldn't know how to handle the content
          inside the tags. The tag starts with "<" then has the class and then ends
          with ">".
          <br> </br>
          <b> The opening tag: </b>
          <br>
          The opening tag is the first HTML tag and is utilised to commence an HTML element.
          It starts with a "<" has the class and then ends with a ">".
          <br> </br>
          <b> The content: </b>
          <br>
          The content inside of the the HTML opening and closing tags is the information that you add for the
          website to contain. It comes in many forms including text, images, videos, audio clips and other
          types of files.
          <br> </br>
          <b> The closing tag: </b>
          <br>
          The closing tag is the ending HTML tag in a HTML element. The difference between the opening tag and
          the closing tag is that the closing tag has a "/" after the "<". The are used to mark the end of an
          element in a website.
          <br> </br>
            <b> After you have read through this and memorised it, we can start learning the code structure (hierarchy)
              in order to make sure that your website code is organised and easy to edit. </b>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="HTML_hierarchy">
        <h3 style="margin-bottom:3%;"> HTML Hierarchy <i> (HTML code structuring) </i> </h3>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veryniceperson/veryniceperson.github.io/master/Images/HTML%20Hierarchy.png" alt='HTML Hierarchy exampls' width="100%" height="auto">
        <p> In the image above you would be able to see how HTML hierarchy works. It starts with parent, then goes on
          with children, siblings, grandchildren and so on. It is important to understand HTML Hierarchy because the
          decendants of different elements can inherit properties such as text colour and font from their ancestors.

          <b> After you have read throught the short paragraph above, lets get started on your first website! </b>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="Getting_Started">
        <h3 style="margin-botton:3%;"> Getting Started </h3>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veryniceperson/veryniceperson.github.io/master/Images/Visual%20Studio%20Image.png" width="20%" height="20%">
        <p> Now we are going to start writing some code! So get your keybooard ready and let's get started!
          <br> </br>
          First of all we are going to need a platform on which we would be able to write our code on. You can either use your own, something
          like <a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank"> Atom</a> or <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com" target="_blank"> Visual Studio</a>. But if you are unable
          to do so, use a <a href="https://repl.it/languages/html" target="_blank"> Online HTML and CSS editor</a>.
          <img src="https://github.com/veryniceperson/veryniceperson.github.io/blob/master/Images/Atom.io%20icon.png?raw=true" width="20%" height="20%">
          <br> </br>
          <b> First of all, </b> erase anything that is present in your HTML editor. Then on top of your document write <code> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </code>. This will allow the user's browser to
          know what type of file it is and how to deal with the file. This should be included in all of your html documents.
          <br> </br>
          In a new line, write <code> &lt;html&gt; </code>. This is the parent of all of the element and will contain all of the content in the document, except for
          <code> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </code>. It is important that you include this tag in all of your html documents.
          <br> </br>
          In another line type in <code> &lt;head&gt; </code>. This element contains content that is usually not displayed on the webpage itself and contains the metadata of the website. Metadata is stuff like
          styling, the title of the website that you see on the tab of your browser, the image that is displayed on the browser tab whenever the website is open and the link to the stylesheet of the website
          <i> (We will get into detail about that in Step 2) </i>.
          <br> </br>
          Now, type in <code> &lt;title&gt; </code> and <code> &lt;/title&gt; </code>. This would allow you to include a title on the tab of a browser for your website. This is optional but, if you don't include a title, the website's
          name on the tab would appear as Untitled (You should include the title text in between the opening and closing tag).
          <br> </br>
          If you want to include a website icon, you can include this code after the <code> &lt;title&gt; </code>: <code> &lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="Insert image link here" /&gt; </code>
          This is optional, but highly recommended because the website icon on the tab of the browser adds a nice touch and makes your website's tab more distinguishable compared to other tabs.
          <br> </br>
          Last, but not least in this list, we have to include a link to our stylesheet. The stylesheet is where you would usually write code to give your different properties such as different fonts, although you could write it in the html document itself. This is optional,
          but it is considered necessary for all websites, because without styling your website would be plain and ugly. On a new line insert <code> &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="insert link here"&gt; </code>. Now you are free to enter which ever stylesheet
          you would want to use.
          <br></br>
          Well done on coming this far!!! Now all you have to do is close the head tag (if you don't remember how to do this you just write <code> &lt;/head&gt; </code> on a line below the second link element) and do 2 things to finish your started template.
          <br> </br>
          Next we have to include the body elememt. The body element is what will contain all of the content of the website, such as text, images, videos and other types of content. First try to write the code for the tags by yourself and remember, the tag is called body.
          If you are stuck, use <code> &lt;body&gt; </code> for the opening tag and <code> &lt;/body&gt; </code> for the closing tag. In between of those two, you will include all of the visible content of the website.
          <br> </br>
          Finally you would need to close off your html tag. Try to do this yourself, but if you are stuck just paste <code> &lt;/html&gt; </code> after the closing body tag.
          <br> </br>
          <b> There!!! Now you have a starter template that you can use for any website you would want to make. Next we are going to learn some elements and how to use them </b>

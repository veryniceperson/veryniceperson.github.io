      <h1> Step 1: Writing the HTML code for your website </h1>

      <h2> In order to start creating your website you would need to learn how to code in HTML. In this step you
      will learn basic HTML, in order to write all of the content of your website.
        <br>
      <b>Let's get started!<b>
      </h2>

      <div class="HTMLcode_parts">
        <h3 style="margin-bottom:3%;"> Parts of HTML code </h3>
        <img src="https://github.com/veryniceperson/veryniceperson.github.io/blob/master/Images/HTML_Anatomy.png?raw=true" alt="Main parts of HTML code" width="40%" height="auto">
        <p> In the image to the right you would be able to see a diagram that represents
          the parts of a single element. The <b> element </b> is a part of code in HTML which
          consists of an HTML tag, the content inside and sometimes some styling.
          <br> </br>
          <b> HTML tag: </b>
          <br>
          The HTML tag contains the element name and helps classify a piece of content,
          because without the tag the browser wouldn't know how to handle the content
          inside the tags. The tag starts with "<" then has the class and then ends
          with ">".
          <br> </br>
          <b> The opening tag: </b>
          <br>
          The opening tag is the first HTML tag and is utilised to commence an HTML element.
          It starts with a "<" has the class and then ends with a ">".
          <br> </br>
          <b> The content: </b>
          <br>
          The content inside of the the HTML opening and closing tags is the information that you add for the
          website to contain. It comes in many forms including text, images, videos, audio clips and other
          types of files.
          <br> </br>
          <b> The closing tag: </b>
          <br>
          The closing tag is the ending HTML tag in a HTML element. The difference between the opening tag and
          the closing tag is that the closing tag has a "/" after the "<". The are used to mark the end of an
          element in a website.
          <br> </br>
            <b> After you have read through this and memorised it, we can start learning the code structure (hierarchy)
              in order to make sure that your website code is organised and easy to edit. </b>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="HTML_hierarchy">
        <h3 style="margin-bottom:3%;"> HTML Hierarchy <i> (HTML code structuring) </i> </h3>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veryniceperson/veryniceperson.github.io/master/Images/HTML%20Hierarchy.png" alt='HTML Hierarchy exampls' width="100%" height="auto">
        <p> In the image above you would be able to see how HTML hierarchy works. It starts with parent, then goes on
          with children, siblings, grandchildren and so on. It is important to understand HTML Hierarchy because the
          decendants of different elements can inherit properties such as text colour and font from their ancestors.

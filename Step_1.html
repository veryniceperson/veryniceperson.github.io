      <h1 style="margin-top: 5%;"> Step 1: Writing the HTML code for your website </h1>

      <h2> In order to start creating your website you would need to learn how to code in HTML. In this step you
      will learn basic HTML, in order to write all of the content of your website.
        <br>
      <b>Let's get started!<b>
      </h2>

      <a name="code_parts"></a>
      <div class="HTMLcode_parts">
        <h3 style="margin-bottom:3%;">Parts of HTML code</h3>
        <img src="https://github.com/veryniceperson/veryniceperson.github.io/blob/master/Images/HTML_Anatomy.png?raw=true" alt="Main parts of HTML code" width="40%" height="auto">
        <p> In the image to the right you would be able to see a diagram that represents
          the parts of a single element. The <b> element </b> is a part of code in HTML which
          consists of an HTML tag, the content inside and sometimes some styling.
          <br> </br>
          <b> HTML tag: </b>
          <br>
          The HTML tag contains the element name and helps classify a piece of content,
          because without the tag the browser wouldn't know how to handle the content
          inside the tags. The tag starts with "<" then has the class and then ends
          with ">".
          <br> </br>
          <b> The opening tag: </b>
          <br>
          The opening tag is the first HTML tag and is utilised to commence an HTML element.
          It starts with a "<" has the class and then ends with a ">".
          <br> </br>
          <b> The content: </b>
          <br>
          The content inside of the the HTML opening and closing tags is the information that you add for the
          website to contain. It comes in many forms including text, images, videos, audio clips and other
          types of files.
          <br> </br>
          <b> The closing tag: </b>
          <br>
          The closing tag is the ending HTML tag in a HTML element. The difference between the opening tag and
          the closing tag is that the closing tag has a "/" after the "<". The are used to mark the end of an
          element in a website.
          <br> </br>
            <b> After you have read through this and memorised it, we can start learning the code structure (hierarchy)
              in order to make sure that your website code is organised and easy to edit. </b>
        </p>
      </div>

      <a name="HTMLhierarchy"></a>
      <div class="HTML_hierarchy">
        <h3 style="margin-bottom:3%;">HTML Hierarchy<i> (HTML code structuring) </i> </h3>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veryniceperson/veryniceperson.github.io/master/Images/HTML%20Hierarchy.png" alt='HTML Hierarchy exampls' width="100%" height="auto">
        <p> In the image above you would be able to see how HTML hierarchy works. It starts with parent, then goes on
          with children, siblings, grandchildren and so on. It is important to understand HTML Hierarchy because the
          decendants of different elements can inherit properties such as text colour and font from their ancestors.
          <br> </br>
          <b> After you have read throught the short paragraph above, lets get started on your first website! </b>

        <p> Now we are going to start writing some code! So get your keybooard ready and let's get started!
          <br> </br>
          First of all we are going to need a platform on which we would be able to write our code on. You can either use your own, something
          like <a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank"> Atom</a> or <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com" target="_blank"> Visual Studio</a>. But if you are unable
          to do so, use a <a href="https://repl.it/languages/html" target="_blank"> Online HTML and CSS editor</a>.
          <img src="https://github.com/veryniceperson/veryniceperson.github.io/blob/master/Images/Atom.io%20icon.png?raw=true" width="20%" height="20%">
          <br> </br>
          <b> Starting off on a black page </b>
          <br>
          Now, erase anything that is present in your HTML editor. Then on top of your document write <code> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </code>. This will allow the user's browser to
          know what type of file it is and how to deal with the file. This should be included in all of your html documents.
          <br> </br>
          <b> The HTML declaration </b>
          <br>
          In a new line, write <code> &lt;html&gt; </code>. This is the parent of all of the element and will contain all of the content in the document, except for
          <code> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </code>. It is important that you include this declaration in all of your html documents.
          <br> </br>
          <b> The <code> &lt;head&gt; </code> tag </b>
          <br>
          In another line type in <code> &lt;head&gt; </code>. This element contains content that is usually not displayed on the webpage itself and contains the metadata of the website. Metadata is stuff like
          styling, the title of the website that you see on the tab of your browser, the image that is displayed on the browser tab whenever the website is open and the link to the stylesheet of the website
          <i> (We will get into detail about that in Step 2) </i>.
          <br> </br>
          <b> The title on the tab of a browser </b>
          <br>
          Now, type in <code> &lt;title&gt; </code> and <code> &lt;/title&gt; </code>. This would allow you to include a title on the tab of a browser for your website. This is optional but, if you don't include a title, the website's
          name on the tab would appear as Untitled (You should include the title text in between the opening and closing tag).
          <br> </br>
          If you want to include a website icon, you can include this code after the <code> &lt;title&gt; </code>: <code> &lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="Insert image link here" /&gt; </code>
          This is optional, but highly recommended because the website icon on the tab of the browser adds a nice touch and makes your website's tab more distinguishable compared to other tabs.
          <br> </br>
          <b> Stylesheet link </b>
          <br>
          Last, but not least in this list, we have to include a link to our stylesheet. The stylesheet is where you would usually write code to give your different properties such as different fonts, although you could write it in the html document itself. This is optional,
          but it is considered necessary for all websites, because without styling your website would be plain and ugly. On a new line insert <code> &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="insert link here"&gt; </code>. Now you are free to enter which ever stylesheet
          you would want to use.
          <br></br>
          Well done on coming this far!!! Now all you have to do is close the head tag (if you don't remember how to do this you just write <code> &lt;/head&gt; </code> on a line below the second link element) and do 2 things to finish your started template.
          <br> </br>
          <b> The body element </b>
          <br>
          Next we have to include the body elememt. The body element is what will contain all of the content of the website, such as text, images, videos and other types of content. First try to write the code for the tags by yourself and remember, the tag is called body.
          If you are stuck, use <code> &lt;body&gt; </code> for the opening tag and <code> &lt;/body&gt; </code> for the closing tag. In between of those two, you will include all of the visible content of the website.
          <br> </br>
          Finally you would need to close off your html tag. Try to do this yourself, but if you are stuck just paste <code> &lt;/html&gt; </code> after the closing body tag.
          <br> </br>
          Now that you are finished, your code should look like this:
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veryniceperson/veryniceperson.github.io/master/Images/Getting%20Started%20example.png" width="100%" height="auto">
          <br>
          <b> There!!! Now you have a starter template that you can use for any website you would want to make. Next we are going to learn some elements and how to use them.</b>
        </p>
      </div>

      <a name="headings"></a>
      <div class="Headings">
        <h3 style="margin-bottom:3%;">Headings</h3>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veryniceperson/veryniceperson.github.io/master/Images/Headings%20Image.png" width="25%" height="25%">
        <p>In this section we will learn how to use headings in your website. Headings are useful for making your website more organised, by including things such as headings and sub-headings for sections of your website. Headings make sure that your viewers know what the
          content would be about and it makes navigating around your website much easier. The headers is also what grabs the viewer's attention, which means that you would have to add a creative heading for your website.
          <br></br>
          <b> How do you use headers? </b>
          <br></br>
          In total there are 6 header tags and the higher the number, the smaller the font of the header by default. For example, text with the h1 tags are going to have a larger font compared to text with h6 tags. You would usually use h1 for main headers and the rest of
          the headings for sub headings. In a new line after the body opening tag, include an opening h1 tag. You should be able to do this by now, but if you don't, just copy and paste <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>. In this course we will be practising by writing about the first iPad,
          but you can write about something else if you like. Then include a suitable title for your website. It can be something like "The first iPad". Now close off the h1 tag.
          <br>
          On a new line, write "What is an iPad?" in between of h2 tags. That will represent your sub-heading. Remember to first open the h2 tag and then close it.
          <br>
          Next, write "When was it created?" in between of h2 tags and then on a new line write "Was it successful?" in between of h2 tags. Lastly add "Pros and Cons" on a new line in between two h2 tags.
          <br>
          Let's take a look at the website you have just created! Just navigate on to the HTML file right click on it and open the file with your internet browser. You would see that the title and other headings that you have written on the HTML file appears on the top of the screen with a large, black font.
          We will work on making it look attractive in step 2, using css code.
          <br>
          You should now be able to use headers for your website. Next we are going to learn how to write paragraphs for your website.
        </p>
      </div>

      <a name="Paragraphs"></a>
      <div class="paragraphs">
        <h3 style="margin-bottom:3%;"> Paragraphs and Line Breaks</h3>
        <img class="paragraphs" src="https://github.com/veryniceperson/veryniceperson.github.io/blob/master/Images/Paragraph%20image.png?raw=true" width="25%" height="25%" style="float: right; margin-left: 5%; right: 0;">
        <p> In this section you will learn how to use paragraphs and line breaks. in your website. Paragraphs are useful for adding information about a topic on your website. Paragraphs are usually located below the heading or sub-heading of you website.
          In order to include a paragraph in your website, you would have to include <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> as your opening tag and <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> as your closing tag. Then, you would include your content in between of those two tags.
          In a website you would usually have to include your <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element under a subheading.
          <br></br>
          In addition, according to the spaces you have in between your elements in the HTML file, is the amount of space you would have in between different groups of content in your website.
          For example, if you have 1 empty line between a h2 element and a p element in the HTML file, you would have 1 empty line between the heading and the paragraph in the website.
          However, this doesn't work with different groups of text in one p element and you would have to include breaks.
          <br> </br>
          One way you could space your paragraph in your website is by having many different p elements. A new p element allows elements to have a double line break in between them, as if you had pressed the enter key.
          Another method is by having only one pair of p tags under a heading and including line breaks in order to seperates paragraphs. The advantage of this is that this method is a bit faster than including new p tags everytime
          and you would be more organised as you would have only one p tag under a heading. The disadvantage of this method is that sometimes you would need to include more than 1 line break, which could confuse some people as they
          would not know how many to include exactly. You would see this method being used in the first image.
          <br></br>
          Line breaks are useful in sepreating content and adding more space between them. Although this is possible to do by adding empty lines in the HTML file itself, sometimes it is
          best to use line break instead of loads of spaces.
          <br> </br>
          Take this situation in this image for example. In the first image you can see that there are lots of empty line in order to
          create some space between the two img elements. This makes the file unorganised and you could delete the spaces if you forget what they are for, which could ruin your website.
          In the second image you can see that with using line breaks, we have a much more organised file and you are less likely to mess up your website by removing the spaces. I
          recommend using line breaks, because you have more freedom to choose where to put a line break and how many line breaks.
        </p>
          <img src="Images/Line Break Example 1.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-bottom:2.5%">
          <img src="Images/Line Break Example 2.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-bottom:2.5%">
          <img src="Images/Line Break Result.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-bottom:2.5%">
        <p> On top of this paragraph you would be able to see the result of the two. The result in both of these codes are the same, the only difference is the structuring and the usage of line breaks.
          As you would be able to see, the example without any line breaks needs lots of empty lines in order to have one space. This can also be done with only one empty line between the 2 elements,
          but the extra lines demonstrate that no matter how many empty lines you have, if there is one empty line between two p elements, only one spacing will be showing in the web browser. This is
          why I recommend using line breaks, because you can customise your webiste whilst keeping the HTML file organised and easy to understand and edit.
          <br></br>
          <b>You should also remember that it doesn't matter if you close off the line break or not. Either the closing or the opening tag would work as line breaks for your website and if you open a br element,
            you don't need to close it. </b>
          <br> </br>
          In order to get some practise do this: On a new line below the "What's an iPad?" subheading, copy and paste the first paragraph from <a href="Whats an iPad.html" class="paragraphs" target="_blank">this</a> in between of p tags. Then, add 2 line breaks, or
          close off this p element and start a new one 2 lines below (you need to have an empty line in between them). After that, add the second paragraph from <a href="Whats an iPad.html" class="paragraphs" target="_blank">this</a>. If you are finished, your website
          should look something like this:
          <img src="Images/Paragraphs end result.png" width="100%" height="auto">
          <br></br>
          <b>Good job! Next we are going to learn how to add images into your website.</b>
        </p>
      </div>

      <a name="images"></a>
      <div class="Imagesinfo">
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 3%;">Images</h3>
        <p>
         In this section you will learn how to use images in your website. Images are important for you website, as they make it easy for your viewer to understand the context of your website. 
         In addition, images are useful for grabbing the visitor's attention, so if you would want to make your website popular, it is recommended that you use images. However, you must make sure 
         that your images are organised and not all over the place, or your website would look bad and unprofessional. 
         <br></br>
         In order to add an image to your website, you must use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. There is no closing tag for the img element, so you just need to opening tag.
         Your img element must have a source. You include a source for the image by writing <code>src="Insert link here"</code> inside the img tag. Remeber, the scr has the be after the img part of the element
         and before the closing angle bracket ">".
         <br></br>
         Let's get some practice by trying this by ourselves. First of all, include an img tag below the "The first iPad" h1 element in your practise website. Next include a source. You can include any image you
         like, even a gif! If you can't choose, you can just use this:<code><a target="_blank" href ="https://d2um6umu4gwssp.cloudfront.net/apple/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ipad-1st-generation-large.jpg">click here for the image link!</a></code>
         Next, include the link using the src tag and remember to close off the element. 
         <br><br>
         Your website should look like this:
         <img src="Images/Image example 1.png" width="100%" height="auto">
         <br>
         For now, the images looks a bit too big. The size of the image by default depends on the size of the image originally. However, we can adjust this very easily.
         <br><br>
         If you would like to adjust the width of the image, you can do so by including this propertiy inside the img tag: <code>width=""</code>. The value can be in either <code>px</code> or %. 
         The px value is in pixels and will stay the same on all screen sizes, but the percentage value will adjust the size of the image according to the screen size.
         <br>
         For example, if you set the width of an image to 100%, the image width would take 100% of the screen width, no matter what. 
         However, if you set it too 100px, the image width would only be 100px on all screens, meaning that it would be too small for some screens and too big for others. 
         <br><br>
         Let's get some practise. Set the width of you image to any value, either in px and 100% and test with differnet widths, in order to know what each value does. 
         If you can't choose, set your image width to 30%. If you had chosen to set it to 30%, it should look something like this:
         <img src="Images/Image example 2.png" width="100%" height="auto">
        </p>
